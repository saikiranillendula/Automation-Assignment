Below is my code 

Prerequisites:
- Pycharm - for Python IDE
- Chrome Driver

Note: POM Model is manly used in unittest and pytest framework it is optional in BDD framework

1. Created a BDD structure in Python and it is done with 'behave' plugin
2. Installed the driver in pycharm folder
4. For report installed allure-behave and executed with the command behave -f allure_behave.formater:AllureFormatter -o reports/ featuresgnment

Note for step 6 in ppt

Report of pass, fail will only appear when we actually run the code.
We can do though with the command called allure-behave plugin.
After that we can get the pass and failed reports.
As it is dummy, there is no need to run the report commands.
